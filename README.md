In this exercise, I'm creating arrays and use various methods to add, remove, and modify the elements. I'm also practicing combining two arrays of hobbies and goals into an array called allTheThings.
I also used map() to map over the allTheThings array. Lastly, I used the return keyword inside the callback funtion to add a string around each element.
